# AndroidScreenCapture
This is the sample application to show how to generate the bitmap of an android layout and to store it in memory.

In this sample i have created a simple screen with a Button.When you click on button.It will create a Bitmap of a Android Layout
and then converts it in form of image .It then stores the image into your device storage.


This scenario may be used in several scenarios such as "Generating the Order for the Customer and Saving the Receipt"..

Following is the screen that i saved as the JPG image.
